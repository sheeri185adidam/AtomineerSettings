		AutoDoc rules
		=============

		For each documentation entry that needs to be generated, Atomineer executes an appropriate
		section of the rules in this AutoDoc section (e.g. for a parameter, the <Parameters> section
		is executed). Execution stops when a match is found and a documentation result is returned.

		Full documentation can be found in the Atomineer user manual.

			<!-- Rules used for enums

				 Full documentation can be found in the Atomineer user manual.

				 Note that you can delete all the examples, and as long as this section does not
				 end with a <Set> command, Atomineer will "fall through" your custom rules and 
				 use its defaults if your rules do not supply any documentation text.

				 Additional values that can be used for filtering/documenting include:
					name			The name of the parameter
					namenp			The name of the parameter, with known prefixes removed
					sName			The name of the parameter, converted to sentence (space separated words) format, with abbreviated words expanded
					specialType		Extra info on the enum: enum, bitfield
					word1			The first word of the parameter (often used for prefixes, e.g. m_, lpsz, etc)
					coreName		The name with the first word removed (to allow processing of prefixed names)
			 -->

				<If sName="# Options" desc="A bit-field of flags for specifying %sname:Plural%" />
